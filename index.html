<p>Hello! I'm a fifth year student at Northeastern studying Finance and Healthcare Management with a minor in Data Science. 
  I'm originally from western Massachusetts and I love living in Boston. I love staying active and some of my hobbies include 
   working out, skiing, watching movies, and rooting for Boston sports teams. After I graduate, I'm going to be working at BCG on 
  the Investment Services team, where I completed a co-op. I hope you find my website interesting!</p>
